# OCR Debug Output Reduction & Visibility Improvements

## Overview
The ScreenAlert application has been enhanced to reduce excessive debug output while providing better visibility for OCR-found text through the user interface.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Debug Level Control
- **Location**: Settings tab â†’ "Debug Level" dropdown
- **Options**:
  - **Minimal** (default): No console output, OCR text shown only in UI
  - **Normal**: Shows alerts when triggered
  - **Verbose**: Shows all debug information (original behavior)

### 2. Enhanced OCR Text Visibility

#### In-Region Display
- Each monitored region now shows the latest OCR-detected text directly below the region name
- Format: `OCR: "detected text" (confidence%)`
- Shows "(no text detected)" when no text is found
- Text is truncated to 80 characters for clean display

#### Dedicated OCR Results Tab
- **New "OCR Results" tab** provides a comprehensive view of all OCR results
- Shows latest detected text for all regions in one place
- Updates every 5 monitoring cycles to avoid performance impact
- Includes:
  - Timestamp of last update
  - OCR engine being used (PaddleOCR-GPU/CPU, EasyOCR-GPU/CPU, or Tesseract)
  - Text and confidence for each region
- **Clear Results** button to reset the display

### 3. Reduced Console Output

#### Startup Messages
- GPU OCR initialization messages only appear in "normal" or "verbose" mode
- Minimal mode shows only critical information (like Tesseract path detection)

#### Runtime Messages
- **Minimal**: No console output during monitoring
- **Normal**: Only shows when alerts are actually triggered
- **Verbose**: Shows all debug information including OCR details

#### OCR Processing
- GPU OCR success/failure messages only in verbose mode
- OCR extraction errors only shown in verbose mode
- Removed repetitive debug messages during normal operation

## Usage Guide

### For Minimal Noise (Recommended)
1. Set **Debug Level** to "Minimal"
2. Monitor OCR results in the **OCR Results tab**
3. Check individual region OCR text below each region name

### For Alert Monitoring
1. Set **Debug Level** to "Normal"
2. Console will show when alerts are triggered with OCR context
3. UI still shows all OCR results

### For Development/Debugging
1. Set **Debug Level** to "Verbose"
2. Full debug output including OCR processing details
3. All original debug messages are preserved

## Performance Benefits
- Reduced console output improves overall performance
- OCR display updates are throttled (every 5 cycles) to avoid UI lag
- Fast-path monitoring skips OCR when no changes detected
- Better user experience with less console clutter

## Configuration
The debug level setting is automatically saved in `screenalert_config.json` and persists between application runs.
